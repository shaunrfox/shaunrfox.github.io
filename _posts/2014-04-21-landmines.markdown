This project was created while I was still in school, but I&rsquo;m still quite proud of it.

Each student was given a non-profit organization and tasked with creating a poster to promote their cause. I was given The International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Through my research, I quickly realized that most of the imagery surrounding this subject was the same. It all relied heavily on shock value with lots of blood and explosions and figures without legs.

The problem is not that those aren&rsquo;t truthful. They are, and that&rsquo;s why this organization exists. Innocent peoples&rsquo; lives are ruined by landmines left in the ground after wartime has ended. The problem is that people are jaded from seeing too much of this kind of imagery &ndash; so much so, that it becomes ineffective.

So I sought to take a more conceptual approach. I wanted to find a way to convey the same idea, but make people have to think about it. In contrast to the way we see gory imagery and immediately turn away, I hoped people would be forced to stop and consider what was being said by using simplified, metaphorical imagery.
