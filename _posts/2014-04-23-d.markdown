A while back I was invited to participate in a <a href="http://thetypefight.tumblr.com/post/33306969032/shaun-fox-and-brendan-pittman-were-once-the-finest">Type&nbsp;Fight</a> against my good friend, <a href="http://brendanpittman.com">Brendan</a>. The letter we were assigned was &ldquo;D&rdquo;. The First image was my entry, and the following images were made along the way.

Turns out, I lost.
