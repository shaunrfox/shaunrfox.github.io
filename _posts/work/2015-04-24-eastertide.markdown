My wife, <a href="http://katiefox.net">Katie</a>, and a few others curated a beautiful collection of poems, writings, and prayers for a devotional for our church. I was thrilled to be able to incorporate some of my photography and wrap it all up into a book, which was handed out to parishioners.

You can even <a href="/assets/other/CC-Eastertide-Devotional-2015.pdf">download the devotional</a>, if you like.
