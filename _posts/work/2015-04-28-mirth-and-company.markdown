My dear friend, John Bell, had a long-time dream to create beautiful, hand-sewn notebooks made with high-quality paper that people would love. Being a master book binder, he knew the kind of care and craftsmanship it would take to pull it off. We joined forces in 2012 and launched a successful Kickstarter Campaign in 2013. After a couple of years of literal blood, sweat, and tears, I took my leave from the world of notebooks, but I wouldn&rsquo;t trade that time for anything.

Thanks to Jeremy Rodgers and Gabe Cox for the wonderful Kickstarter video and to my daughter, Molly, for sewing her share to help out (see last photo).
