This book contains a collection of quotes which artists have received regarding their work. Some of them are funny, some ridiculous. We took these quotes and paired each of them with an interpreted illustration.

The entire book was screen printed on French paper and book board, then hand bound with strips of innertube and some fancy red book tape.

It&rsquo;s definitely best experienced in person, so let me know if you&rsquo;d like to have a look.
