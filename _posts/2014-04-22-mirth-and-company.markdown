My dear friend, John Bell, had a long-time dream to create beautiful, hand-sewn notebooks made with high-quality paper that people would love. Being a master book binder, he knew the kind of care and craftsmanship it would take to pull it off. We joined forces in 2012 and launched a successful Kickstarter Campaign in 2013. After a couple of years of literal blood, sweat, and tears I have taken my leave from the world of notebooks, but I wouldn&rsquo;t trade that time for anything.

Here&rsquo;s a glimpse into the funny world of hand-sewn notebooks. Thanks to Jeremy Rodgers and Gabe Cox for the wonderful Kickstarter video and to my daughter, Molly, for sewing her share to help out (see last photo).
