As of March, 2012 the Fox family is a family of four. We spent two years in the process of adopting our younger daughter from Colombia.

Along the way, my wife and I did a lot of extra work and creative projects to raise money to fund our adoption. One of these projects was downloadable valentine&rsquo;s cards. We designed a series of these to be printed on letter-sized paper and cut out for all your sweeties. In the end we had six separate pages of downloadables with fun illustrations and phrases. This is just a sample of my favorites.
