I was asked to do some branding and promotional materials for an event called <i>The&nbsp;Bible&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Ecology</i>. I wanted to convey the topic in a way that would be intriguing and get people to show up to the talk. Each letter portrays a different scene that invites the viewer to consider how a biblical view of ecology would affect each aspect of our life.

In addition to the custom lettering, I also produced flyers and a small, responsive website.
