My wife remembers the way her mother played X Marks the Spot with her finger on her back when she was a child. And now it&rsquo;s something we do with our two daughters.

I decided to illustrate the playful process and bind it into a little book to be able to share this tradition with others.

The book is printed on a single sheet of French paper, then cut and folded to create a little zig-zag book that&rsquo;ll fit in your pocket.
