My friend Tsh Oxenreider runs a <a href="http://www.theartofsimple.net/">successful blog</a>. In 2011 she gathered up a lot of her great tips and published them as an e-book.

There are 52 &ldquo;life simplification projects&rdquo; to organize and categorize. It was my first time to do an e-book and it brought some new things to the table. I really like how it turned out. If you&rsquo;re interested, it&rsquo;s available to <a href="http://52bites.com/">purchase here</a>.
