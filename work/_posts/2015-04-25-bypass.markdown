During my time at Bypass, my main task was updating the existing interface and workflows of multiple apps. These were used daily by our customers, so workflow modifications were a delicate process. Some of the Android apps had disparate visual design, yet similar functionality, so we brought them all under one unified look and even combined some of them.

I also got the chance to create some new applications from scratch. Lots of times it&rsquo;s helpful in the process to make live mockups to see how things will play out. Here are a few that I made along the way:
