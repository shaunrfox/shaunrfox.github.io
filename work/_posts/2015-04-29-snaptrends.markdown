In my role as Director of Product Design at Snaptrends, I oversee the interface design and user experience of our application. We&rsquo;ve reworked the entire user interface and we&rsquo;re constantly adding new features and updating existing ones.

Some of the most recent work has been updating the existing charts. Through this effort we&rsquo;re not only bringing a new look, but also new interactions to allow the user to dig into the data behind the charts and take action on it.

In combination with the static mockups shown here, I've made many live mockups to prove out the choices I've made, from interface interactions and nuances to layout and responsive design.
