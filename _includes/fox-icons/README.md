# Fox Icons!

Hand crafted SVG icons by Shaun Fox. Free to use, not to sell.

[See all the icons on my site.](http://shaunfox.com/icons)

### Install

bower install fox-icons

### To use, just drop this in your html with the appropriate name swapped out:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 30 30" class="ico-fox">
  <use xlink:href="#ico-fox"></use>
</svg>
```

### How to use in bower

To add it to your bower file, do the usual bower thing:
```bash
bower install --save fox-icons
```

However, because this repository is frequently updated, I'd reccomend changing your bower file to something like this
```json
"fox-icons": "*"
```
