			<div class="rule background-orange" style="margin-bottom: 40px;"></div>

			<blockquote>Here are some things that I care about, which I hope form the ethic for my work and my life.</blockquote>

			<p class="label">I&rsquo;m interested in people.</p>
			<p>I think that collaboration makes a better product every time. I think that the more people work together on the front end, the more the product will feel human on the other end. I also love working directly with clients and finding awesome solutions to their problems and goals.</p>

			<p class="label">I&rsquo;m interested in delight.</p>
			<p>I want the people who interact with the products I make to know that a real person made it. I want them to sense that there was a lot of care put into it and that I made it just for them.</p>

			<p class="label">I&rsquo;m interested in family.</p>
			<p>My wife and daughters are so great. I think they&rsquo;re the best thing in the world. And my coworkers end up being like family, too. I&rsquo;ve been privileged to work with awesome people over the years, who&rsquo;ve become a big part of my life.</p>

			<p class="label">I&rsquo;m interested in making a difference.</p>
			<p>As much as I can I&rsquo;d like to work for the greater good. I want my work to be meaningful and not hurtful. I want to help people, because in some ways I think that&rsquo;s what life is all about.</p>

			<p class="label">I&rsquo;m interested in learning.</p>
			<p>In fact, I can&rsquo;t really seem to stop. Whether learning a new hand-skill or illustration technique or a better way to write code, I&rsquo;m always looking to improve. I think this is essential in a creative field. <br><i>Input = output</i>.</p>
