This project was completed in my final semester of school and was done in collaboration with my good friend, <a href="http://randrenfrow.com">Rand Renfrow</a>.

This book is a collection of actual quotes which artists have received regarding their work. Some of them are funny, some ridiculous. We took these quotes and paired each of them with an interpreted illustration.

The entire book was screen printed on Mr. French paper and book board, then hand bound with strips of innertube and some fancy red book tape.

It&rsquo;s definitely best experienced in person, so let me know if you&rsquo;d like to have a look.
